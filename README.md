# Timberborn-Mods
One central location for my timberborn modding efforts.

# Developer Setup
Development requires Visual Studio
Compilation of the mod dlls requires certain libraries that I do not have the rights to redistribute. Please compiling and run the PopulateLibDir project. This will copy the appropriate files from your local Timberborn installation and download the correct BepInEx files.
